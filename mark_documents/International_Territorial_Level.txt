International Territorial Level (ITL) is a geocode standard for referencing the subdivisions of the United Kingdom for statistical purposes, used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). From 2003 and until 2020 it functioned as part of the European Union and European Statistical System's geocode standard Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics or NUTS.
Following Brexit, the ONS set to develop a domestic statistical classification framework separate from NUTS. Currently, the ITLs are a mirror to the pre-existing NUTS system, they retain the same three level hierarchy and boundaries used for NUTS in the United Kingdom since 2018, with the next review scheduled for 2024. ITLs are set to follow a similar review timetable to NUTS, being reviewed every three years. The ONS will develop new official GSS codes of ITL geography aligned with the existing NUTS codes. From 1 January 2021, the ONS encourages "ITL" be used as a replacement to the "NUTS" designation, with lookups between NUTS and ITL maintained and published until 2023.The current ITL classification is a mirror of the previous NUTS classification with slight modification, the ONS lists 12 regions at ITL 1, 41 regions at ITL 2, and 179 regions at ITL 3. "UK" in the NUTS codes were replaced with "TL".
The last NUTS classification is dated 21 November 2016 and was effective from 1 January 2018, listed 12 regions at NUTS 1, 40 regions at NUTS 2, and 174 regions at NUTS 3 level.

The 12 ITL regions of the United Kingdom are listed below. Population numbers are for mid-2019 (as NUTS 1), and areas are in square kilometres. Data is from the Office for National Statistics.

History
NUTS 2003
In the first version in 2003, North Eastern Scotland (which then included part of Moray) was coded UKM1, and Highlands and Islands was coded UKM4.
The current NUTS level 1 codes start with "C" (following "UK") rather than "1" because the new list reflected the revised regions of England and local government changes throughout the UK; "1" to "B" had been used for the 11 regions in the previous coding system.

NUTS 2006
NUTS 2006 came into force on 1 January 2008.

NUTS 2010
NUTS 2010 came into force on 1 January 2012.2010 changes to NUTS 2 also resulting in changes with NUTS 3 regions

The combined area of UKD2 (Cheshire pre-2010) and UKD5 (Merseyside pre-2010) were replaced by UKD6 (Cheshire post-2010) and UKD7 (Merseyside post-2010), due to the transfer of Halton to the Merseyside NUTS region from Cheshire. This resulted in the following changes to the underlying NUTS 3 areas:  UKD22 (Cheshire CC) being split into UKD62 (Cheshire East) and UKD63 (Cheshire West and Chester); The areas of Liverpool, Sefton and Wirral were not changed as NUTS 3 areas however to reflect their transfer within NUTS 2 areas were respectively renumbered from (UKD52 to UKD72; UKD53 to UKD 73 and UKD54 to UKD 74). The two areas of UKD51 (East Merseyside pre 2010) and UKD21 (Halton and Warrington) were amended by the transfer of Halton from the latter to former to form the new areas of UKD71 (East Merseyside post-2010) and UKD61 (Warrington).2010 changes to NUTS 3 areas without changes occurring to NUTS 2 areas

Local administrative units
Below the ITL levels, the two LAU (Local Administrative Units) levels are:
